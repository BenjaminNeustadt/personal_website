This repository contains notes about anything.  It is set up to create an HTML
or PDF book format for this information, and uses Asciidoctor to do so.

In order to create this as a compiled resource, you can run:

[source, sh]
----
make
----

This command will make the `book.pdf` file.

If you would prefer to make the HTML file, then the following command is required instead:

[source, sh]
----
make html
----
