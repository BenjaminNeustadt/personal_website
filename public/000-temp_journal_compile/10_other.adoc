https://highlightjs.org/[highlight.js] versus https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge[rouge syntax highlighter]

The primary difference in terms of functionality is that rouge supports line numbering, whereas highlight.js does not,
however the latter supports dark theme/light theme, whereas the former does not.

Currently, we are using rouge for the source code highlighting in this document, but will probably try out highlight.js instead,
as it would be nice to have the source code stand out from the rest of the page with a dark theme which would actually be more in tune with the GUI
interface of the our terminal set-ups anyway.
