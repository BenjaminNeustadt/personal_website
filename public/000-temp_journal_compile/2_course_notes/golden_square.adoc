The Golden Square refers to four software engineering practices:
- Test-Driving (TDD)
- Object-Oriented Design (OOD)
- Debugging
- Pairing

With strong skills in each of thse areas, you will be able to do a great deal of useful work as egineer.

__**Test-Driving**__

---
Test-driving is a mthod for creating software that involves:
1. Deciding what you want software to do
2. Writing tests to check that it does that.
3. Writing the code to pass those tests

It is called test-driven dev because you write the tests first and then focus on makingthem pass.
THe tests 'drive' the implementation.

There are a number of reasons people do this.
One key reason to test-drive is because it structures your prgramming approach and reduces your mental load.

__**Object-Oriented Design**__

---

Object-oriented design is a way of structuring code using objects and classes. The software is created by creating a systme of classes that interact,
to perform the job of the software.

Classes are blueprints for objects, and objects encapsulate ('wrap') values ('state' or 'memory'), providing methods that control access to those values and fo useful work.

Structuring programs is very important becaus programs can get large and hard to understand.
If you don't break them down into small parts each with a particular job they become expensive and time-consuming to maintain..

There are a number of approaches to structuring programs. OOD is the most popular.

//Question: what are some of the others?


---


__**Debugging**__

---
Debugging is the name for a collection of different aproaches for dealing with the situation when the codes does something you don't intend it to for reasons you don't understand.

It is important because code is complex and people rearely get it totally right.
Good debugging skills help and engineer disover the source of defects ('bugs') and thereby correct them.

---


__**Pairing**__

---

Pair programming = 2 programmers working on the same thing at the same time. SOme teams do pairing 100% of the time, most do it some of the time,
and some never do it.

It is very useful because it can apply two minds and two sets of knowledge to the same problem,
and because it spreads knowledge around a team. As an engineer, knowldge of the system is a very valuable thing, and so pairing makes the while team more effective.
