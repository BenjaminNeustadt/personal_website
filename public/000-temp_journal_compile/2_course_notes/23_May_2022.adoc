Notes from single moethod TDD
Design Recipe

-----------------------------------------------

Spike can free code to a certain point.

But when doing a more complex problem, TDD is a necessary process that allows you to do that.

.Notes from test driving:

RSpec test created around same time as the program.
Just before (3 minutes according to ichael).

RSpec create, check that is passes

Then try to break it: "mutation" to verify what it does  what and if you can break the test.
